This is a reference for some of the advanced topics in C++. I tried to summarize the information found in different resources, complement it with my understanding, and provide some practical examples.

## Topics Covered
* Move semantics in modern C++: rvalue, lvalue and std::move
* Move constructors
* Move assignment operators
* Copy constructors
* Copy assignment operators
* Virtual functions and runtime polymorphism

## Files Structure
There are two ways to add comments to `.cpp` files: `/*(Text)*/` and `//`.  
The former is used to provide explanations and further information.   
The latter is used to comment code. You can uncomment lines starting with "//" and execute the examples.  

## Contribution
I would be happy to add your summary files to this repo. We can come back to these file to review and refresh our memory.  
Submit a pull request if you are interested. For consistency let's adhere to the above structure.
