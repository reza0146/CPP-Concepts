lvalue: a variable/object that has both a name and a memory address. 
    lvalues can appear on the left or right of an assignment operator (=).
    lvalue references are denother with one &.
    example: std::string hello("Hello"); // hello is an lvalue
rvalue: a variable/object that has only a memory address. 
    These are temporary objects that are created on the fly and destructed after being assigned/passed. 
    rvalues can appear only on the right of an assignment operator (=).
    rvalue references are denoted with double &&.
    example: std::string str;
    vec.pushback(str + str); // (str + str) is an rvalue.
*/

/*
std::move() is a function used for converting an lvalue reference to an rvalue reference. 
See here: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/move

move constructors were introduced to make passing objects more efficient. A move constructor steals the resoueces fro mthe source object and 
leaves the source object in a valud but unspecified state. They are used as a more efficient version of copy constructors whenever 
the object being copied is no longer needed (rvalues). It's important to note that whatever that is passed to a move constructor 
will be destroyred. 

The copy constructor uses the lvalue references which are marked with one ampersand (&) 
while the move constructor uses the rvalue references which are marked with two ampersands (&&).
*/

/*
Important notes:
    * Calling a std::move() on a const object has no effect. It doesnâ€™t make any sense to steal or move the resources of a const object.
    * If Move semantics is not defined, copy semantics will be used as an alternative.
    * If there is no implementation taking rvalue reference as an argument, the implementation with const lavlue reference argument will be used instead.
    * If both of the implementations above are missing and there is only one implementation of a function with non constant lvalue argument, 
    that will be used.
